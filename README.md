## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run in Python 3 with no problems. No additional packages are needed. 

Follwoing are the used libraries:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - seaborn
 - matplotlib.pyplot

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I set up a different recommendation algorithms. The user-item matrix was created using both dataframes.  

    - Collaborative Filtering was used with the method of the nearest neighbors. 
    - Content Based Recommendations
    - Matrix Factorization (SVD)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The used data consists of two dataframes and can be downloaded here.

The steps of the analysis can be viewed in the Crisp_DM_history.ipynb file. There is also a single jupyter file for each question to generate the desired plots.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the results can be found in the notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I thank IBM for offering the data. You can also use the code here and run the model by yourself. Maybe you even have an idea for adjustments or improvements.
